README Solar System Three.js:

This README file will explain how to interact with the HTML/JavaScript files. The user simply needs to open the HTML files through a python local webserver 
to load the textures and models correctly (do not move the folders containing these files from the same directory as the html files). The following text snippet explains how to open a local webserver:

1. Start a local webserver and access the files via it:

a. Open a command line or terminal in the directory with your files.

b. Start a simple webserver with Python: “python -m http.server”.
This will tell you the port on which the server is listening (e.g. 8000).

c. In your web browser, go to “http://localhost:PORT”, where “PORT” is the
number reported in Step b.
 
To move the camera, with the mouse or the touchpad press and drag to move the camera around as it uses a arcball mode camera. You can also zoom in and out by pressing i and o respectively.
Pressing p will play/pause the music. Pressing d will start/stop the disco mode of the scene. Press l to change the randomly generated lights while in the disco mode. Finally, pressing d restores the 
original scene.
